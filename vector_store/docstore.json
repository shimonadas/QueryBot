It is continuous, cross-platform, and culturally layered\u2014reaching fans through a daily rhythm of content, commentary, and connection. Fans are checking in daily, forming habits and touchpoints that stretch far beyond the circuit. The shift to always-on engagement signals an opportunity to rethink content not only as a supplement to the race, but as a primary driver of fandom itself.

Strategic Implications. 03 Content Engagement - 2025 Global F1 Fan Survey 47 Engagement strategies must adapt. Successful engagement strategies must adapt across platforms and audience types\u2014without losing the connective thread of the sport. Content should play multiple roles: Formula 1 has become a global content brand\u2014where drivers are stars, fans are creators, and every day is part of the sport somewhere online. Countries like Brazil, Italy, and the Netherlands\u2014reminds us that the core product remains potent. Anchoring engagement in race-day rituals while expanding the ecosystem between events is where long-term loyalty will be won. They\u2019re primary discovery engines, especially among fans under 30. This underscores the need for content that travels natively across digital formats. Platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and social media are no longer second screens. The enduring strength of live race viewership. Bottom line. \u2022 An amplifier for new fans. \u2022 A knowledge hub for legacy fans. \u2022 A bridge to commerce, helping fans express their identity through merch and community. Strategic Implications. 03 Content Engagement - 2025 Global F1 Fan Survey 48 Examples Include: A Content Ecosystem in Motion. F1 Spotlight While the data highlights evolving fan behavior, it also underscores how Formula 1 has strategically adapted its media footprint to meet fans where they are\u2014 serving a global audience now estimated at over 860 million.

Formula 1 fans are no longer satisfied with being spectators. Across regions and demographics, live experiences have become central to how fans engage with the sport\u2014whether attending a Grand Prix, joining social events, or exploring off-track activations.

Fans overwhelmingly cite the impact of local races on their emotional connection\u2014especially in emerging and underserved markets. In key markets like the U.S., intent to attend far exceeds current attendance, underscoring untapped opportunity. Strategic Implications. An evolving live engagement model. Intent signals are especially strong: Home races are loyalty drivers: Off-track engagement is growing: Experience gaps remain: Digital fuels demand: 04 Live Events The data confirms that live and in-person experiences are now a core component of fandom, not an optional extra.
